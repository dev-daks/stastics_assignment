    "Nature of Data: Nominal data is characterized by categorical variables that are labeled or named with no inherent order or ranking. The categories are distinct and mutually exclusive, but they do not have any numerical value or implied order. In contrast, ordinal data also represents categorical variables, but they have an inherent order or ranking among the categories. The order may be based on preferences, rankings, or levels of agreement/disagreement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Measurement Scale: Nominal data is measured on a nominal scale, which means that the values represent different categories without any numerical significance. The numbers assigned to the categories are arbitrary and used solely for identification purposes. In ordinal data, the categories are also labeled or named, but they represent a meaningful order or rank. The numerical values assigned to the categories indicate the relative position or rank of the categories but not the magnitude of the differences between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analytical Possibilities: In nominal data, statistical analysis mainly involves descriptive techniques, such as frequency counts, mode, and cross-tabulations. It is used to examine the distribution and relationships among the categories. In contrast, ordinal data allows for more advanced statistical analysis. Besides descriptive techniques, ordinal data can be used in inferential statistical tests like the Mann-Whitney U test, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, or Spearman's rank correlation, which take into account the order or ranking of the categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Operations: Nominal data does not permit arithmetic operations, as the numbers assigned to the categories lack numerical significance. It is inappropriate to calculate measures such as the mean or standard deviation for nominal variables. On the other hand, in ordinal data, certain operations can be performed to examine the direction and magnitude of the order. For example, you can determine whether one category is ranked higher or lower than another, calculate medians, or perform non-parametric test that compares the rank between the groups"

    "Median: The median is the middle value in an ordered dataset. It divides the dataset into two equal halves, with 50% of the values above and 50% below it.\n",
    "Uses: The median is robust to extreme values and is a better measure of central tendency for skewed distributions or datasets with outliers. It is commonly used to describe the central value in income distributions or housing prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mode: The mode is the most frequently occurring value or values in a dataset.\n",

    "Measures of Variability:\n",
    "\n",
    "Range: The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset.\n",

    "Definition: The median is the middle value in an ordered dataset. It separates the dataset into two equal halves, with 50% of the values above and 50% below it.\n",
